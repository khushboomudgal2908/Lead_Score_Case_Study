# Lead_Score_Case_Study
 Education Lead Scoring Case Study Introduction X Education, an online education company, aims to enhance its lead conversion process by identifying potential leads more efficiently. Currently facing a low lead conversion rate, the company is seeking a data-driven solution to assign lead scores to each prospect. The goal is to prioritize and focus on leads with higher conversion potential, ultimately increasing the overall lead conversion rate to around 80%.

Data Overview The dataset provided contains approximately 9000 data points, including various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. The target variable, 'Converted,' indicates whether a lead was converted (1) or not (0). Additionally, it is crucial to address categorical variables with a level called 'Select,' treating it as a null value.

Objectives Data Preprocessing:
Handle 'Select' levels in categorical variables. Explore and clean the dataset for missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies. Building a Logistic 

Regression Model:
Implement a logistic regression model to predict the probability of leads getting converted. 

Model Evaluation and Refinement:
Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics. Fine-tune the model to optimize lead score predictions.
